# Machine Learning Practices - Project (CS2008p)

## About the Project
- This is my project for the course **CS2008p (Machine Learning Practices Project)** under the BS in Data Science and Applications degree.

- The problem statement is to predict a customer’s **purchase value** based on multi-session behavioral data.
    - The goal is to estimate the total purchase value made by a customer using features such as session activity, device information, traffic source, and geographic context.

## Steps in the ML Project
The general workflow followed in this project includes:

1. Understanding the problem and the dataset  
2. Loading and exploring the data  
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization  
5. Feature engineering and selection  
6. Model selection and training  
7. Model evaluation using R² score  
8. Prediction on test data and submission file creation  
9. Interpretation and inference  

## Data Information

- This project deals with a regression task where the objective is to predict the continuous target variable `purchaseValue`.

- The dataset consists of multiple sessions per user and includes features such as:
  - Session details (hits, page views, session number)
  - Device information (type, browser)
  - Traffic source details
  - Geographical data (continent, city, region)
  - Purchase value as the target

- The evaluation metric used is the **R² (coefficient of determination) score**, which measures how well the model explains variance in the target variable.

---

- Provided files include:
  - `train_data.csv`: Training dataset containing features and the target variable.
  - `test_data.csv`: Test dataset without the target variable; used for final predictions.
  - `sample_submission.csv`: Sample submission format file.
